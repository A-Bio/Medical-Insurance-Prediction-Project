# **Medical Insurance Prediction Project**
This project aims to use machine learning techniques to predict medical insurance costs based on various factors such as age, sex, BMI, number of children, smoking status, and region. The goal is to understand the relationships between these features and the charges, allowing the creation of a robust predictive model.The dataset used for this project contains information about individuals' insurance charges and associated characteristics.

**Project Overview**
The objective of this project is to predict medical insurance charges using machine learning. By leveraging various features, such as age, BMI, smoking status, and sex, this project applies regression model to predict the insurance charges for individuals. The project includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and the use of machine learning model for prediction.

**Dataset Sources**
The dataset used for this project is publicly available on Kaggle and contains the following columns:
**age**: Age of the individual
**sex**: Gender of the individual
**bmi**: Body Mass Index (BMI) of the individual
**children**: Number of children/dependents covered by the insurance
**smoker**: Whether the individual is a smoker or not
**region**: The region of residence of the individual
**charges**: Medical insurance charges (Target variable)

**Analysis Breakdown**
1. **Data Preprocessing**
**Missing Values Handling**:
The dataset contains no missing values.
**Feature Encoding**:
The column smoker, sex & region is categorical. They were encoded into binary values (0 & 1) to be used as input for machine learning models.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
**Data Summary**:
The dataset is initially explored by calculating summary statistics (mean, median, and standard deviation) for each feature.

**Visualizing Distributions**:
**Histogram**: The distribution of key features such as charges, bmi, and age is visualized to understand their shapes (normal, skewed, etc.).
**Countplot**: Countplot is used to show the distribution of features like children and sex.

**Correlation Analysis**:
A correlation matrix is computed to identify relationships between features. 

3. **Modeling**
**Model Selection**:
**Linear Regression**: A basic regression model used to predict charge

**Model Training**:
The model is trained on the dataset, with features such as age, bmi, smoker, and children used to predict charges. Cross-validation is applied to evaluate the models' generalization ability.

4. **Model Evaluation**
**Evaluation Metrics**:
Model is evaluated using:
R² Score: Indicates how well the model fits the data, with values closer to 1 representing better fit.

**Modeling and Results**
This project applies machine learning regression model to predict medical insurance charges. The steps involved are:
**Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.
**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing the relationships between features and understanding data distributions.
**Modeling**:Linear Regression
**Evaluation**: The model's performance is assessed using R² score.

**Technologies Used**
**Python**: The main programming language used for data analysis and machine learning.
**Pandas & NumPy**: Libraries for data manipulation and numerical computations.
**Scikit-learn**: For building and evaluating machine learning models.
**Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization.
**Google Colab**: Interactive computing environment for executing and documenting the analysis.
